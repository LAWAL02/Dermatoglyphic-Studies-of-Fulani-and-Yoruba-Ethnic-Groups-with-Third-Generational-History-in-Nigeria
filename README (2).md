# ðŸ”¬ Fingerprint Analysis with Visualizations

This notebook presents a structured analysis of dermatoglyphic data comparing fingerprint patterns and minutiae features across Fulani and Yoruba ethnic groups in Nigeria. The analysis replicates and expands upon published results using Python for statistical testing and visual interpretation.

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives:
- Replicate key findings from a dermatoglyphics research study
- Visualize differences in fingerprint pattern types (e.g., arches, whorls, loops) by gender and ethnicity
- Compare minutiae characteristics such as bifurcations, ridge endings, bridges, and lakes
- Perform statistical analysis (e.g., T-tests) for significance testing

## ðŸ“ˆ Highlights:
- Pattern distribution analysis by gender and ethnic group
- Minutiae frequency comparisons with bar charts
- Statistical testing using Scipyâ€™s t-test for pattern significance
- Fully reproducible code and visual outputs using Matplotlib and Pandas

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries Used:
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas, NumPy â€“ for data structuring
- Matplotlib â€“ for plotting
- SciPy â€“ for statistical testing

## ðŸ§  Background:
This project is based on a published anatomical study focused on ethnic and gender differentiation through fingerprint biometrics. The notebook simulates key data from the study and demonstrates how Python can be used for reproducible scientific computing.

## âœ… Outcome:
The analysis reinforces findings that certain fingerprint features can serve as potential biometric markers for ethnic or sex-based differentiation. This work also highlights how open-source tools can support medical and forensic data interpretation.
